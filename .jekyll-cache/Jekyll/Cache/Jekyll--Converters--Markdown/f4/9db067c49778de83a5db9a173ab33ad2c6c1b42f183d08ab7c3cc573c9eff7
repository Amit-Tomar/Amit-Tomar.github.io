I"Ï<p><small>Hello. This is my first blog post. Its been so long that I wanted to have a website that could act as a blog-cum-profile. After toiling for more than a week, going through 100s (if not 1000s!) of website and blogs, I realized nothing beats minimalism. And so I have settled down with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> or <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon">poole</a> to be precise. It took me another week to modify the themes and bring down to a point where it has just enough things. I have integrated <a href="https://disqus.com/">DISQUS</a> for comments, took some lovely icons from <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">FontAwesome</a>, added navigation at the top bar, added page scroller to top, social media icons to share posts, among other. <a href="http://markdotto.com/">Mark Dottoâ€™s</a> website is a great inspiration on aesthetics. I hope I will be able to focus more on content now than on the feel of it. </small></p>

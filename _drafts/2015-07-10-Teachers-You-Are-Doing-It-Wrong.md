<big> Recently we defended our respective thesis work of six months at IIITB. This write up describes the overall experience and some suggestions for anyone who might be interested in taking up thesis. </big> ( With inputs from [Shivam](http://shivam-agarwal.github.io) and [Srinivas](https://www.facebook.com/srinivas.r.vaidya)) 

### Why did I choose thesis over an internship ?

<small>I had around two and half year of work experience before I joined IIITB. So it was a little easier for me to take this decision. I believe that an internship is o do a thesis.</small>

### Why would you wanna do thesis ?

*	<small> **Don't ask students to come prepared**: </small>

*	<small>**Fair, Quantifiable, Precise, Transparent ,Verifiable, grading mechanism**:</small>

Good teachers I know have a very very fair approach towards grading. They give grades not on the basis of personal repo of the student, but his or her performance. But this has an importatn pre-step of precisely defining what will be the judging criterion, how will the marks be distributed. This transparecny build up a student's confidence in the process. Saying things like "10% of marks are based on class participation" is as vague as it can get. It leaves doubt and uncertainty in the mind of students. It can also lead to a lack of trust with the teacher.  

*	<small>**Give a problem statement - Why do we need something? **</small>

*	<small>Build up your subject with real world problem statement. Resnick Halliday examples</small>

*<small>**Let them explore first **</small>

<small>Don't teach concepts directly. Try to simulate the young eager minds to come with solutions to these problems on their own first. In this process they will discover many things which you were planning to teach them. The best example is the class by Saurabh Sir on different sorting techniques. What you discover yourself, remains wth you forever.</small>


*<small>**Give open ended problems - Open Book exams - No need to cram anything**
</small>

<small>If you put in enough</small>

*<small>**Share the problems asked by one person, with everyone**
</small>

<small>When a student asks a question, many times Profs. direct their attention towards that person and answer him one to one. I found in my experience of taking some tutorial classes that this breaks the rythm of the overall class. Answering a student in isolation not only deprives everyone else of a probably good question/answer but also makes them feel a lesser part of the overall class.  </small>

*<small>**Be open to questions - Encourage question asking - Take pause only for questionss** </small>

<small>If you put in enough</small>

*<small>**Relate topics to real world phenomenon Problems**</small>
<small>If you put in enough</small>

*<small>**Talk about life - teacher's aim is to build a better human - helps relate to kids - Ask their schedule and about other subjects they have.** </small>
<small>If you put in enough</small>

*<small>**Give cooperative assignments rather than commpetetive**</small>
<small>If you put in enough</small>


*<small>**Give bigger picture before diving deep.**</small>
<small>If you put in enough</small>


*<small>**Explain the subject in larger context.**</small>
<small>If you put in enough</small>


*<small>**Take feed back (anonymously if that works better), and take feed back seriously.** </small>
<small>If you put in enough</small>


*<small>**Teacher-Student relationship**</small>
<small>If you put in enough</small>

*<small>**Take feedback while designing the coursework**</small>
<small>Srikanth sir took suggestions</small>

 
*<small>**There used to be a teacher-student relatioship when we were kids, which is largely missing now in higher level technical education.** </small>
<small>If you put in enough</small>


*<small>**Be open to feeback and be receptive, but go lookout for feedback, like bugs** </small>
<small>If you put in enough</small>

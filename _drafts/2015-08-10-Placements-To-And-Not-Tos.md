Please note that all views expressed here are personal and might not necessarily be in sync with your batch's placement policy. In case of a conflict, respect your batch policy over any such points mentioned here.

### Things you should be doing

*	<small>**Do prepare**</small>

<small> Preperation beats smartness, knowledge, luck etc. hands down. Specially if you have work experience, don't feel that you already know C++/JAVA etc. and will sail through easiely. You might have previous experience with it, but still prepare and sharpen up yourself. </small>

1. <small>**Technical**</small> : <small>Everything else apart, you are applying for an IT company. A minimum standard of technical comppetance will definately be expected from you. First and foremost is Algorithms and Data Structure. Other than them, be through with atleast these subjects - Operating Systems, Database Management systems, Computer Networks. Knowing things like design patterns will be an added bonus.</small> 

2. <small>**Personal**</small> : <small>Preparing you core technical subjects is essential, but so is preparing yourself for the HR/Managerial interview rounds. Hopefuly, you got exposure to some public speaking during the summer semester. I know many people for whom not being able to speak up in english with confidance was a major problem. If you feel the same about yourself, do talk to your friends about it and try conversing them in english on a  regualr basis. </small>

*	<small>**Keep calm**</small> 

<small>Everybody gets a job at IIITB. Its mostly a matter of time. Some might get it just when the third sem begins, while for others it might come up as late as the convocation. It might be a long journey for many, and keeping your calm during this period would be difficult. Don't get your nerves take upon you. Playing games/jogging can be very helpful. </small>

*	<small>**Wait for your favorite sweet**</small>

*	<small>**Cooperate than comppete**</small> Take placement process headon as a team, as a batch, and it will give lot better results. Take KSMs, they will be helpful for a lot of people. Instead of waiting for others to take it, take initiative yourself. It will improve you preperation level and give you confidence. I myself prepared hard and went through lots of material before taking KSMs on C and felt lot more confident.

*	<small>**Be part for other's happiness**</small> Yes, for most of us, there will be good friends who will get placed before us. Be a part of their happiness. Participate, party with them. It will be one of the happiest moment of many people's lives, and it would be great if you could be around them.

6. Better to land at a place that suits you

7. Statups vs established giants

8. Big names vs job profiles

9. Attend pre-placements talk / ask questions to clarify


### Things you should not be doing

10. Don't underestimate yourself : Lot of people taking up offers after a few rejections

1. Don't isolate yourself - Yes, a few months into placemnts, when half your batch is placed, most of your friends are relaxing and you are still struggling to find out whats wrong with your, depression starts to creep in. Please don't isolate yourself in such situations. Talk to your friends about it. Speaking out what you feel is a great way to feel relaxed. Also, take feedback from others about where you might be getting wrong. People around you can give good feedback on points you might improve upon. Also, feel free to bug your seniors as well. Take advices with a pinch of salt, but getting ideas won't hurt you.

2. Don't compete - Nops, don't. There will be (more than) enough companies visiting the campus. There is no point to run over others and find a place. Everyone will get a decent chance to prove their worth in so many companies, so instead of making war with people around you, work with them. Group studies will take you forward.

3. Don't ignore studies - In all this, don't overlook your studies. This is important not only because it will impact your CGPA (and can be cruicial if you are on that thin line of 2.8) but also because you are part of such a nice institute and have got exposure to great people, facilities etc. Make use of them. Untill you decide to take up a Phd. you will rarely find such smart people once you start working. The bigger objective of being here in IIITB is probably not just to take up a job but find something meaningful which you can focus your career on. If you haven't started loving playing with tons of data yet, or those colorful graphics don't excite you, or developing web interfaces doesn't seem challenging to you yet, take your time and explore more in your respective stream (or out of it!) and try finding something that excites you enough. Spend more time with the subjects. Third sem offers some of the coolest subjects and ignoring them (as some of us seniors will suggest) over lighter ones, will not be a good idea IMHO. If you prepare well during the summer semester, placement season can easiely go on in parallel with your studies in third sem, otherwise it will get tough.

4. Other ways to get placements - 

a. Hackathons
b. HackerRank monthly challenged
c. Industry funded Lab projects

Afterwards -

1. Help others.
2. Don't stop working.
3. Try more.
4. Work hard in your internships.

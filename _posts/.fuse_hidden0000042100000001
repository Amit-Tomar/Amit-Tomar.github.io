<big> So you have landed up at IIITB. Decision of taking up a stream and electives are two decisions that will come back haunting you time and again, regardless of what you decide to chose. In this blog I focus on the later and that too from a very focused perspective for people having interest in the field of graphics, visualization etc. There is no particular specialization 'Computer Graphics' per se at IIITB, but there is a set of subjects, taken from different streams, which if you can plan and take seriously, will help you build up a very good profile in this domain. </big>

### Why did I choose thesis over an internship ?

<small>I had around two and half year of work experience before I joined IIITB. So it was a little easier for me to take this decision. I believe that an internship is more or less IT experience, which I already had. Thesis is an opportunity which would be difficult to get again in life. The idea of getting to work with Profs. for almost six months was more exciting to me than doing an internship. I did apply for one particular company before making this decision official. I was very interested in it and it offered only internships ( that is no direct full time offers ). Once I couldn't clear their interviews, I was sure I wanted to do a thesis.</small>

### What I worked on ?

<small>I worked with [Prof. Jaya Sreevalsan-Nair](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty_page.php?name=jayasreevalsannair) and my thesis was titled 'Augmenting NodeTrix for Effective Small World Network Visualization'. It involved some improvements over the existing visualization called NodeTrix. I used D3.js and OpenGL for the implementation part. I had taken a reading elective on 'Small World Networks' in the third semester and this work was a logical extension to it. </small>

### What was the overall experience like ?

<small>Overall it was fun. Yes, there were times of frustration, boredom, feeling helpless, but overall it was greatly satisfying. This would not have been possible without the presence of Srinivas, Shivam and Prashant around, during this period. </small>

### Possible Misconceptions about Thesis

*	<small>**Thesis need different kinds of technical skills.**</small>

<small>Nope it doesn't. There is enough time to learn any kinds of tools/technology that might be required for your work, on the fly. So if not knowing Python/Matlab/Java/Android/R/LaTeX or anything else is stopping you from taking a decision, think about it again. That being said, thesis does require different kind of personal skills. You should be sincere, self-motivated and patient at the least. You will be mostly working independently with guidance from your Prof., many times not realizing what direction your work is going in. Not getting good/expected results will test your patience for sure.</small>

*	<small>**Thesis doesn't pay you enough money compared to an internship.**</small>

<small>Well yes, in direct comparison stipend offered can be substantially lower than the average stipend given by companies. However, you do save both money and time by not traveling. Since you will be in hostel for these six months, you will be probably paying lesser as rent than those who would have to move out of campus. Plus you get to enjoy campus life/events for another six months. </small>


### Why would you wanna do thesis ?
*	<small> **Very diluted Phd flavor**: If you plan to take up a Phd. in future but are not sure about it, then taking up a thesis might help you in making this decision. Although thesis is not comparable to a full-fledged Phd. in any sense, it does give you a mild idea of how does it feel like to work independently. You might end up getting a glimpse of frustrations that Phd. candidates would face for a substantially longer period of time.<small>

*	<small>**Publish paper**: If you put in enough efforts, you might end up publishing a paper on your work. It is an accomplishment in itself and shows one's capability of working under minimal supervision. This could be very helpful in applying for Phd. admissions. <small>

*	<small>**Get to know Profs.**: You will be spending a good amount of time interacting with your Prof. during this period. You will get to know them closely and might end up learning minute nuances of their trade. Working so closely with them and interacting with them on different ideas is a very nice experience. This close interaction also improves your chances of getting a letter of recommendation from them, in case you need it for further studies. </small>

<small>Hello. This is my first blog post. Its been so long that I wanted to have a website that could act as a blog-cum-profile. After toiling for more than a week, going through 100s (if not 1000s!) of website and blogs, I realized nothing beats minimalism. And so I have settled down with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) or [poole](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) to be precise. It took me another week to modify the themes and bring down to a point where it has just enough things. I have integrated [DISQUS](https://disqus.com/) for comments, took some lovely icons from [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/), added navigation at the top bar, added page scroller to top, social media icons to share posts, among other. [Mark Dotto's](http://markdotto.com/) website is a great inspiration on aesthetics. I hope I will be able to focus more on content now than on the feel of it. </small>

<small> Feel free to share how it looks now in comments! </small>

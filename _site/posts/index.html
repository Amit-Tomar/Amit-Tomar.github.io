        Placements, To-Do and Not To-Do..
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Oct 2017</span>

    <p><big>Placements, time of the year which will evoke several of your emotions. It might get tough, but you will most probably cherish this time after a few years. Following are some points which might help you in sailing smoothly through this time. </big></p>

<p><sub><sup> * Please note that all views expressed here are personal and might not necessarily be in sync with your batch’s placement policy. In case of a conflict, respect your batch policy above everything.</sup></sub></p>

<h3 id="things-you-should-be-doing">Things you should be doing</h3>

<ul>
  <li><small><strong>Do prepare</strong></small></li>
</ul>

<p><small> Preperation beats smartness, knowledge, luck etc. hands down. Specially if you have work experience, don’t feel that you already know C++/JAVA etc. and will sail through easiely. You might have previous experience with it, but still prepare and sharpen up yourself. </small></p>

<p><small>1. <strong>Technical</strong></small> : <small>Everything else apart, you are applying for an IT company. A minimum standard of technical competence will definately be expected from you. First and foremost is Algorithms and Data Structure. Based on your stream you might be expected to know certain subjects well. Other than what is relevant for your stream, do have basic understanding of how Operating Systems, Database Management Systems, Computer Networks, and Web works. </small></p>

<p><small>2. <strong>Personal</strong></small> : <small>Preparing you core technical subjects is essential, but so is preparing yourself for the HR/Managerial interview rounds. Hopefuly, you got exposure to some public speaking during the summer semester. Speaking in English might seem a trivial thing to many, but I know many people for whom not being able to speak up in english with confidance was a major problem. If you feel the same about yourself, do talk to your friends about it and try conversing them in english on a regualr basis. I have friends who were initialy petrified by the idea of speaking up in interviews, but over time gained confidence and cracked through easiely. Important thing is to identify it as a weakness and then working on it.</small></p>

<p><small> 3. <strong>Resume</strong></small> : <small> If possible, prepare your resume using LaTeX tools. It generates very professional looking resumes. There are ready made templates available on internet to just fill in your details. Keep the resume &lt;= 2 pages. No body will have time to read through stuff more than that. Proof read several time and use some tools to check for spelling and grammatical mistakes in it. You should know about every single word you have mention in the resume. Do not mention skills which you are not confident about or atleast mention them in various degreess of your understanding. Most importantly do not bluff about stuff you have not done.</small></p>

<ul>
  <li><small><strong>Keep calm</strong></small></li>
</ul>

<p><small>[Almost] Everybody gets a job at IIITB. Its mostly a matter of time. Some might get it just when the third sem begins, while for others it might come up as late as the convocation. It might be a long journey for many, and keeping your calm during this period would be difficult. Don’t let your nerves take upon you. Playing games/jogging, regularly spending time with friends can be very helpful. </small></p>

<ul>
  <li><small><strong>Wait for your favorite sweet</strong></small></li>
</ul>

<p><small>If you are a <i>Kaju Katli</i> lover, hold on your temptaion on seeing an icecream cone. Just because a lot of people like a company (or are simply applying for it) doesn’t mean you should do that too. Read about what work the comany does, what kind of roles are they offering, package structure etc and then make a personal decision. Do not go by what others like and decide for yourself what is that excites you. After not making through a few comapny’s many people get desperate and start applying for random company/profiles which might not be a good match for their skills/expertise/interests. I personally feel its absolutely alright to let a few go. Its better to land at a comapny with a profile that suits you, rather than just getting any random high paying job which might not sound interesting to you.</small></p>

<ul>
  <li><small><strong>Cooperate rather than to compete</strong></small></li>
</ul>

<p><small>Take placement process head-on as a team, as a batch, and it will give lot better results. Take KSMs, they will be helpful for a lot of people. Instead of waiting for others to take it, take initiative yourself. It will improve you preperation level and give you confidence. I myself prepared hard and went through lots of material before taking KSMs on C and felt lot more confident afterwards.</small></p>

<ul>
  <li><small><strong>Be part for other’s happiness</strong></small></li>
</ul>

<p><small>Many time there will be good friends who will get placed before you. Be a part of their happiness. Participate and party with them. It will be one of the happiest moment of many people’s lives, and it would be great if you could be around them. Try to keep that bitterness than creeeps in on not getting an offer to yourself and enjoy a little with those happy on getting an offer.</small></p>

<ul>
  <li><small><strong>Attend pre-placements talk / ask questions to clarify</strong></small></li>
</ul>

<p><small>Do not go by general perception about the company. Attend their talks and see what roles are they offering and clearly understand the salary structure offered. </small></p>

<ul>
  <li><small><strong>Statups vs established giants / Big names vs job profiles</strong></small></li>
</ul>

<p><small>You will be in dilemna about these at many points. Again, do not go by general perception about them. Create an opinion of your personal self after carefuly analysing the company / role / salary / your interests / your family condition etc. What works for other need not work for you at all. If its a well thought through personal decision, any of the above is a great option. </small></p>

<ul>
  <li><small><strong>Take care of yourself and Sleep Well</strong></small></li>
</ul>

<p><small>Can’t emphasize enough how important small things like taking proper sleep a night before your placement is. Eat and sleep on time and if possible exercise regularly. Do not let the placement overrrun your normal schedule. </small></p>

<ul>
  <li><small><strong>In larger scheme of things, none of this will matter</strong></small></li>
</ul>

<p><small>After a few years you will realize and may be even laugh on how you were unnecceasrily worried and tensed during placement times. On a long enough scale of life, this might not even matter. </small></p>

<h3 id="things-you-should-not-be-doing">Things you should not be doing</h3>

<ul>
  <li><small><strong>Don’t underestimate yourself</strong></small></li>
</ul>

<p><small>Lot of people taking up random offers after a few rejections. It is absolutely alright to not get through the processes of companies. Just try to analyze what could have been done better. Talk to friends and take feedback on what could you be doing wrong. </small></p>

<ul>
  <li><small><strong>Don’t isolate yourself</strong></small></li>
</ul>

<p><small> Yes, a few months into placemnts, when half your batch is placed, most of your friends are relaxing and you are still struggling to find out whats wrong with your, depression starts to creep in. Please don’t isolate yourself in such situations. Talk to your friends about it. Speaking out what you feel is a great way to feel relaxed. Also, take feedback from others about where you might be getting wrong. People around you can give good feedback on points you might improve upon. Also, feel free to bug your seniors as well. Take advices with a pinch of salt, but getting ideas from others won’t hurt you. </small></p>

<ul>
  <li><small><strong>Don’t compete</strong></small></li>
</ul>

<p><small>Nops, don’t. There will be (more than) enough companies visiting the campus. There is no point to run over others and find a place. Everyone will get a decent chance to prove their worth in so many companies, so instead of making war with people around you, work with them. Group studies will take you forward. </small></p>

<ul>
  <li><small><strong>Don’t ignore studies</strong></small></li>
</ul>

<p><small>In all this, don’t overlook your studies. This is important not only because it will impact your CGPA (and can be cruicial if you are on that thin line of 2.8) but also because you are part of such a nice institute and have got exposure to great people, facilities etc. Make use of them. Untill you decide to take up a Phd. you will rarely find such smart people once you start working. The bigger objective of being here in IIITB is probably not just to take up a job but find something meaningful which you can focus your career on. If you haven’t started loving playing with tons of data yet, or those colorful graphics don’t excite you, or developing web interfaces doesn’t seem challenging to you yet, take your time and explore more in your respective stream (or out of it!) and try finding something that excites you enough. Spend more time with the subjects. Third sem offers some of the coolest subjects and ignoring them (as some of us seniors will suggest) over lighter ones, will not be a good idea IMHO. If you prepare well during the summer semester, placement season can easiely go on in parallel with your studies in third sem, otherwise it will get tough. </small></p>

<h3 id="other-ways-to-get-placements">Other ways to get placements</h3>

<ul>
  <li><small><strong>Hackathons</strong></small></li>
</ul>

<p><small>Keep an eye on Hackathons going around. Many a times company representatives are also present in such events and might offer you jobs directly. Several companies post direct job offers based on Hackathons results as well. Do get yourself familiar with such websites hosting Hackathons.</small></p>

<ul>
  <li><small><strong>Good Websites</strong></small></li>
</ul>

<p><small>Other than your regular job hunting sites, there are sometime good opportunities waiting for not so tradational job hunting sites as well. I found some decent jobs openings on <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/jobs/">LinkedIn</a>,  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/jobs?med=site-ui&amp;ref=jobs-tab">Stackoverflow</a>, <a href="https://hiree.com/">Hiree</a> and very nice startup oriented ones on <a href="http://angel.co">Angel</a>.</small></p>

<ul>
  <li><small><strong>Industry funded Lab projects and Startups at IIITB</strong></small></li>
</ul>

<p><small>There are several industry-academia collaboration based projects going in various labs of IIITB. The pay structure here might not be very lucarative but the quality of work in very good most of the times. Also, there are several startups working in the incubation center of IIITB. You can try finding open positions there as well.</small></p>

<ul>
  <li><small><strong>Your Profs.</strong></small></li>
</ul>

<p><small>This is mostly related to people who are doing thesis, but can be tried by others nevertheless. Most Prof. have good industry relations and might at times know of openings at such places. Also, they might hire you in the Acad-Industry projects running at IIITB as Research Assistants. </small></p>

<h3 id="afterwards">Afterwards</h3>

<ul>
  <li><small><strong>Help others</strong></small></li>
</ul>

<p><small>Once you are through you will be in a more relaxed state of mind so don’t hesitate to help people who are finding it difficult to get jobs. Make sure to be humble in any such attempts.</small></p>

<ul>
  <li><small><strong>Don’t stop studies</strong></small></li>
</ul>

<p><small>Don’t let getting a job offer stop you from continuing hard work. Continue the learning process till you graduate and even after that.</small></p>

<ul>
  <li><small><strong>Work hard in your internships</strong></small></li>
</ul>

<p><small>Once you start doing your interships, work hard and try to convert them into full time offers.</small></p>

<p><br /></p>

        Computer Graphics as a stream
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">27 Aug 2015</span>

    <p><big> So you have landed up at IIITB. Decision of chosing a stream and electives are two decisions that will come back haunting you time and again, regardless of what you decide to tak up. In this blog I focus on the later and that too from a very focused perspective, for people having interest in the areas of graphics, visualization etc. </big></p>

<hr />

<p><small>There is no particular specialization ‘Computer Graphics’ per se at IIITB, but there is a set of subjects, taken from different streams, which if you can plan and take seriously, will help you build up a very good profile in this domain. Following is the list of subjects that you can take up : </small></p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<ul>
  <li><small><strong>Linear algebra and Probability</strong> | GEN501 (Prof. Neelam Sinha and Prof. Poonacha)</small></li>
</ul>

<p><small>I can not emphasize the importance of learning Linear Algebra properly to do any significant work in the field of graphics. From modelling to rendering, simulations to animations, everything rely heavily on LA principles. Being part of prep-sem these courses are covered in a very short span of time and most people are not able to grasp any of it. So, later on, whenever you get time (or rather make sure you make yourself take time for this), make sure that you read up and practise them properly. From Computer Graphics point of view, a light read in the form of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1568817231/ref=rdr_ext_tmb" target="_blank">Mathematics for 3D graphics and games</a> is a very good resource. Various LA principles are covered in relation to applications in the field of Computer Graphics. For LA in general I liked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Its-Applications-Edition/dp/0201709708" target="_blank"> Linear Algebra and it’s Applications </a> by David Lay. Many people recommend <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/" target="_blank"> Video lectures by Gilbert Strang </a> and his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Linear-Algebra-Fourth-Edition/dp/0980232716" target="_blank"> Introduction to Linear Algebra </a> as a good source. </small></p>

<h3 id="essentials">Essentials</h3>

<ul>
  <li><small><strong>Computer Graphics</strong> | CS606 (Prof. Jaya and Prof. Sreekanth)</small></li>
</ul>

<p><small>This course covers fundamentals of Computer Graphics by using OpenGL as programming base. Although it is mostly based on the old OpenGL programming, but the fundamentals are very nicely covered. Do solve all the assignments and go through every paper mentioned in the course notes. These assignments and papers are hand picked and are the papers which you will mostly encounter in industry. Same goes for the papers covered in the Advanced Computer Graphics course. There will be an assignment on modern OpenGL in the form of shaders programming, do take it seriously. If possible take it forward on your own and try to make some small programs using shaders. This will be helpful in your transformation
to modern OpenGL later on.</small></p>

<ul>
  <li><small><strong>Advanced Computer Graphics</strong> | CSD602 (Prof. Jaya and Prof. Sreekanth)</small></li>
</ul>

<p><small>This course was started in fall 2014 when some of us (read <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/srinivasrvaidya" target="_blank"> Srinivas </a>) showed great interest and requested Prof. Jaya and Prof. Sreekanth to
cover some more topics. This course has several papers from modelling, rendering, animation etc. and covers rather modern advancements in the field of Graphics. I personally find this as the best course I attended at IIITB. You can’t have such intellectual freedom in any other course. As said earlier, the set of papers are very very carefuly selected and are almost the essentials for computer graphics students. As much as possible, do not just read the papers, but try implementing them as well. Atleast plan it out with pen and paper as to how these papers could be implemented.</small></p>

<ul>
  <li><small><strong>Introduction to Scientific Computing</strong> | GEN 601 (Prof. Jaya)</small></li>
</ul>

<p><small>(Unfortunately I did not attend this course . So following content is based on inputs from others)</small></p>

<p><small> This course covers essential mathematical fundamentals of scientific computing which can be applied to various domains in general. The mathematics learned in this course is not specific to graphics and can be applied to several domains. It is again an assignment based course. Mathematics learned will be very
helpful if you want to develop some serious physical simulations systems. Depending on time, there might as well be introduction to OpenMP/OpenCL/Matlab/CUDA
programming which goes hand in hand with most Graphics programmers. </small></p>

<ul>
  <li><small><strong>Data Visualization</strong> |  (Prof. Jaya)</small></li>

<p><small> (Partially audited) This course looks at field of visualization from a practical point of view. Comprises mostly of assignments of which scientific visualization ones are to be done in C++/OpenGL and information visualization ones in mostly HTML/JS/D3.js etc. In case you do not have exposure to OpenGL programming this course would be difficult to manage. It covers several general visualization techniques and provides an overview of various visualizations. If you have inclination towards visualizing data, this is the course for you.</small></p>

        Doing Thesis, Why and How?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Jun 2015</span>

    <p><big> Recently we defended our respective thesis work of six months at IIITB. This write up describes the overall experience and some suggestions for anyone who might be interested in taking up thesis. </big> ( With inputs from <a href="http://shivam-agarwal.github.io">Shivam</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/srinivas.r.vaidya">Srinivas</a>)</p>

<h3 id="why-did-i-choose-thesis-over-an-internship-">Why did I choose thesis over an internship ?</h3>

<p><small>I had around two and half year of work experience before I joined IIITB. So it was a little easier for me to take this decision. I believe that an internship is more or less IT experience, which I already had. Thesis is an opportunity which would be difficult to get again in life. The idea of getting to work with Profs. for almost six months was more exciting to me than doing an internship. I did apply for one particular company before making this decision official. I was very interested in it and it offered only internships ( that is no direct full time offers ). Once I couldn’t clear their interviews, I was sure I wanted to do a thesis.</small></p>

<h3 id="what-i-worked-on-">What I worked on ?</h3>

<p><small>I worked with <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty_page.php?name=jayasreevalsannair">Prof. Jaya Sreevalsan-Nair</a> and my thesis was titled ‘Augmenting NodeTrix for Effective Small World Network Visualization’. It involved some improvements over the existing visualization called NodeTrix. I used D3.js and OpenGL for the implementation part. I had taken a reading elective on ‘Small World Networks’ in the third semester and this work was a logical extension to it. </small></p>

<p><img src="/images/Thesis.png" alt="Augmented NodeTrix" /></p>
<center>Augmented NodeTrix</center>

<h3 id="what-was-the-overall-experience-like-">What was the overall experience like ?</h3>

<p><small>Overall it was fun. Yes, there were times of frustration, boredom, feeling helpless, but overall it was greatly satisfying. This would not have been possible without the presence of Srinivas, Shivam and Prashant around, during this period. </small></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="possible-misconceptions-about-thesis">Possible Misconceptions about Thesis</h3>

<ul>
  <li><small><strong>Thesis need different kinds of technical skills.</strong></small></li>
</ul>

<p><small>Nope it doesn’t. There is enough time to learn any kinds of tools/technology that might be required for your work, on the fly. So if not knowing Python/Matlab/Java/Android/R/LaTeX or anything else is stopping you from taking a decision, think about it again. That being said, thesis does require different kind of personal skills. You should be sincere, self-motivated and patient at the least. You will be mostly working independently with guidance from your Prof., many times not realizing what direction your work is going in. Not getting good/expected results will test your patience for sure.</small></p>

<ul>
  <li><small><strong>Thesis doesn’t pay you enough money compared to an internship.</strong></small></li>
</ul>

<p><small>Well yes, in direct comparison stipend offered can be substantially lower than the average stipend given by companies. However, you do save both money and time by not traveling. Since you will be in hostel for these six months, you will be probably paying lesser as rent than those who would have to move out of campus. Plus you get to enjoy campus life/events for another six months. </small></p>

<h3 id="why-would-you-wanna-do-thesis-">Why would you wanna do thesis ?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><small> <strong>Very diluted Phd flavor</strong>: If you plan to take up a Phd. in future but are not sure about it, then taking up a thesis might help you in making this decision. Although thesis is not comparable to a full-fledged Phd. in any sense, it does give you a mild idea of how does it feel like to work independently. You might end up getting a glimpse of frustrations that Phd. candidates would face for a substantially longer period of time.<small></small></small></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><small><strong>Publish paper</strong>: If you put in enough efforts, you might end up publishing a paper on your work. It is an accomplishment in itself and shows one’s capability of working under minimal supervision. This could be very helpful in applying for Phd. admissions. <small></small></small></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><small><strong>Get to know Profs.</strong>: You will be spending a good amount of time interacting with your Prof. during this period. You will get to know them closely and might end up learning minute nuances of their trade. Working so closely with them and interacting with them on different ideas is a very nice experience. This close interaction also improves your chances of getting a letter of recommendation from them, in case you need it for further studies. </small></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><small><strong>Get to know yourself</strong>: You get to know a lot about yourself as an individual. Where do your weaknesses stand, what are your strong points, how much pressure can you handle, can you keep yourself self motivated etc. </small></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><small><strong>You don’t have to travel</strong>: Saves time, money and keeps you away from the frustration of traffic jams.</small></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><small><strong>Placements</strong> : Depending on how you plan, you can get time to prepare for full time placements. Staying in campus will be advantageous as you won’t have to travel back on weekends whenever a company visits. However, it is strongly advices to get placements done in the third semester itself. It will give you free mind to work.</small></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-wouldnt-you-wanna-do-thesis">Why wouldn’t you wanna do thesis?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><small><strong>Losing out on some companies</strong>: Although there will be lots of companies offering stand alone full-time offers, there are quite a few only offering internships. Only way you can get into them is via taking up an internship and then converting it into a full-time offer. Mind you, these can be some good companies, and can prove out to be a disadvantage if you are highly interested in joining any such company. However, if you put in nice enough efforts, chances are that your guide will help you to get interview call for some jobs which are related to your work. There is no official rule / certainty for this, but is still a possibility.</small></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><small><strong>Canteen food</strong> : If you think canteen food sucks. </small></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><small><strong>Its very easy to lose track</strong>: With so much time in hand and no one to constantly push/monitor you, its easy to lose track of what you are doing. If you choose to take up thesis without strong motivation, it will be difficult to carry yourself enthusiastically till the end. </small></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><small><strong>If you get bored easily</strong>: You will be mostly working on a single idea all this time. You will be reading/implementing a lot, but only in this restricted scope. This can get boring sometimes.</small></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="some-advice-if-you-do-decide-to-take-up-thesis">Some advice if you do decide to take up thesis</h3>

<p><small> We (me, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/srinivas.r.vaidya">Srinivas</a> and <a href="http://shivam-agarwal.github.io" target="_blank">Shivam</a>) discussed a lot about things we could have done better. Following are some point that came up : </small>
<br /></p>

<p><img src="/images/ThesisUnplanned.png" alt="How most thesis work out" /></p>
<center>How most thesis work out</center>

<p><br /></p>

<p><img src="/images/ThesisPlanned.png" alt="What ideal thesis would look like!" /></p>
<center>What ideal thesis would look like!</center>

<p><br /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><small><strong>Start early</strong> :  If you plan to take up thesis, do take a reading elective in the previous semester. One of the major reason for not getting sufficient time to experiment enough is that a lot of time is spend in literature survey. If you take up reading elective, it will not only help you in covering a lot of papers beforehand but will also give you an idea about how comfortable you will be working with the Prof. Doing your RE sincerely is half your work done. Implement the state-of-art papers in this semester only. This will give a lot of time and scope for experimentation during your thesis work. If this part is not done beforehand, it will consume a major chunk of overall thesis time. </small></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><small><strong>Work in groups</strong> : This is probably something all of us realized at the end of thesis work. Working on a larger common problem could have been more fruitful. We also felt that pair-programming worked great whenever we had worked together earlier. Moreover, each other’s company was a great comfort on its own. If possible do give a thought on taking up thesis as a team of two-three people, if your Prof. allows that. Even if you end up doing thesis in different topics/domain, try setting up your work environment in same Lab/Library etc. It will be highly beneficial both technically and morally. Working alone in your room is not advised. </small></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><small><strong>Chart out overall plan</strong>: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/srinivas.r.vaidya">Srinivas</a> was probably the only person doing this. Making a rough overall plan with time line can be very helpful in planning things up. With so much time in hand, it is very easy to go off track. Just having rough estimates should work out fine. Keep the granularity of your planning at around 15 days. eg. <strong>Week 1-2</strong> : Reading paper U,V,W and Implementing algorithm X. <strong>Week 3-4</strong> : Learning GPU programming, implementing parallel version. <strong>Week 5-6</strong> : Implement algorithm X with changes Y and Z and match performance differences. etc.</small></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><small><strong>Prepare report along with</strong>: Try not to wait till the last month to begin writing thesis. Take thesis template (in LaTeX format) from any of the seniors or library and keep filling it throughout the thesis work. Whenever you are conducting any sort of experiments, do write why you conducted, were the outcomes favorables, what was the data set used, save the results with proper labels etc. Not doing this will make it very difficult to recollect all this information at the end. </small></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><small> <strong>Pick Prof. you are comfortable with</strong>: There are some Profs. which are more <em>popular</em> than others. Try not to follow other’s opinion about a Professor. See how comfortable you personally are working with them. Taking up a reading elective can help in this process. </small></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><small><strong>Pick a sport</strong>: Playing sports on regular basis will be very beneficial in keeping you calm. Pick anything from TT/Football/Cricket/Badminton etc. and follow it up regularly. I personally had great experience jogging in the evenings and it helped me a lot by keeping me motivated and charged up during the thesis duration. </small></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><small><strong>Define your thesis topic as precisely as possible</strong>: Define your problem statement with as minute details as possible. Write down the expected outcomes and overall work you will be doing before hand. Do validate the feasibility of implementing it in the given time frame. </small></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><small><strong>Feeling of ‘my work is a waste’</strong>: There will be time where you will be feeling that whatever you are doing is just redundant work, most of it already done by others. Understand that even a minor original contribution is an achievements itself. This could be working out an algorithm for different data sets, combining two algorithms to generate a new one, tweaking small changes in any step of the algorithm etc. </small></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-choose-thesis-topics">How to choose thesis topics</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><small><strong>Join some LAB</strong>: If possible be a part of a lab at IIITB. This will be helpful to give you an idea about various projects/ideas floating around in your domain. Collaborating with MS/Phd. students will also prove beneficial. </small></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><small><strong>Problem statements in your domain</strong>: There are several website posting interesting real time challenges in different domain. Such problems are very well defined and have clean data sets associated with them. For visualization communities <a href="http://shivam-agarwal.github.io">Shivam</a> suggests looking at problems in <a href="http://ieeevis.org/">IEEEVis</a>, <a href="http://www.infovis-wiki.net/index.php?title=Main_Page">InfoVis Wiki</a>, <a href="http://www.infovis.org/infovis/">Old InfoVis competitions</a></small></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><small><strong>Different research papers type</strong>: Read about different <a href="http://ieeevis.org/year/2012/info/call-participation/paper-submission-guidelines#PaperTypes">paper types in IEEE</a>. This can give you an idea about different themes your work can fall in. Eg. coming up with a new algorithm, analyzing some existing algorithm etc. You can then define you problem statement accordingly.</small></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><small><strong>Read previous years thesis</strong>: Read up some previous years thesis to see the kind of work done earlier under some Professor. If you like some of the ideas, you can try and extend them in your own thesis work. It will also give a good idea about what a thesis work will feel like in the end.  </small></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="addendum">Addendum</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><small><strong>Thesis Defense</strong>: The last date for submitting thesis and internship report is somewhere around 15th of June. Do confirm this once with the placement office. After submitting the report you have to present your work in an open seminar where a couple of professors and students (you can call your friends) are present. But seminar happens in a very friendly and encouraging environment. Instead of pointing out your mistakes, Profs. will actually help you to understand what could have been done better and how you can take your work forward. </small></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><small><strong>Paper Publication</strong>: It would be wonderful if you can bring it to a point where you can publish the work, but it is not a compulsion at all. After you graduate, it is difficult to work on it further. So even if paper is not complete when you submit your thesis, do continue working on it while you are still to join a company, and try publishing after you graduate. Your Profs. will help you for sure. It took over an year, but I was finally able to get mine published in the form of a paper with the help of <a href="http://shivam-agarwal.github.io">Shivam</a> and <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/faculty_page.php?name=jayasreevalsannair">Prof. Jaya</a> </small> <br /></p>

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 May 2015</span>

    <p><small>Hello. This is my first blog post. Its been so long that I wanted to have a website that could act as a blog-cum-profile. After toiling for more than a week, going through 100s (if not 1000s!) of website and blogs, I realized nothing beats minimalism. And so I have settled down with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> or <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon">poole</a> to be precise. It took me another week to modify the themes and bring down to a point where it has just enough things. I have integrated <a href="https://disqus.com/">DISQUS</a> for comments, took some lovely icons from <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">FontAwesome</a>, added navigation at the top bar, added page scroller to top, social media icons to share posts, among other. <a href="http://markdotto.com/">Mark Dotto’s</a> website is a great inspiration on aesthetics. I hope I will be able to focus more on content now than on the feel of it. </small></p>

<p><small> Feel free to share how it looks now in comments! </small></p>

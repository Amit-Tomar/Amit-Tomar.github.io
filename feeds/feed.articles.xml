				<title>Hello World!</title>
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;Hello. This is my first blog post. Its been so long that I wanted to have a website that could act as a blog-cum-profile. After toiling for more than a week, going through 100s (if not 1000s!) of website and blogs, I realized nothing beats minimalism. And so I have settled down with &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/poole/lanyon&quot;&gt;poole&lt;/a&gt; to be precise. It took me another week to modify the themes and bring down to a point where it has just enough things. I have integrated &lt;a href=&quot;https://disqus.com/&quot;&gt;DISQUS&lt;/a&gt; for comments, took some lovely icons from &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/&quot;&gt;FontAwesome&lt;/a&gt;, added navigation at the top bar, added page scroller to top, social media icons to share posts, among other. &lt;a href=&quot;http://markdotto.com/&quot;&gt;Mark Dotto&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; website is a great inspiration on asthetics. I hope I will be able to focus more on content now than on the feel of it. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; Feel free to share how it looks now in comments! &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
